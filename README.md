Recipe Search Program
Welcome to the Recipe Search program! This application allows you to search for recipes based on a specific ingredient. The program uses the Edamam Recipe API to fetch recipe data. Before you begin, please make sure you have read the Edamam API documentation here.

How to Use the Program
To get started, run the recipe_search.py file in your Python environment.

The program will prompt you to enter the ingredient you want to search for. Please type in the name of the ingredient and press Enter.

The program will make a request to the Edamam API with the entered ingredient as part of the search query. Ensure you have the necessary Application ID and Application Key from the Edamam API.

The API will return a list of recipes matching the search query.

The program will then display the recipes along with some key details for each search result.

You have the option to save the search results to a file. The program will prompt you to specify the filename, and the results will be saved in that file.

Ordering the search results by weight.

Asking the user additional questions to help them decide which recipe to choose based on dietary preferences and approximately kcal contained in a dish.

Important Note
Please note that the API key for this project is not provided in the code to ensure the security of your API credentials. Make sure to replace the YOUR_APP_ID and YOUR_APP_KEY placeholders in the recipe_search.py file with your own Edamam API credentials.
