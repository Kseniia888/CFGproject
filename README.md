Recipe Search Program

Welcome to the Recipe Search program! This application allows you to search for recipes based on a specific ingredient. The program uses the Edamam Recipe API to fetch recipe data. Before you begin, please make sure you have read the Edamam API documentation here.

How to Use the Program
Get Started: To begin, run the recipe_search.py file in your Python environment.

Search by Ingredient: The program will prompt you to enter the ingredient you want to search for. Simply type in the name of the ingredient and press Enter.

Fetch Recipes: The program will make a request to the Edamam API with the entered ingredient as part of the search query. Ensure you have the necessary Application ID and Application Key from the Edamam API.

View Results: The API will return a list of recipes matching the search query. The program will then display the recipes along with some key details for each search result.

Save Search Results: You have the option to save the search results to a file. The program will prompt you to specify the filename, and the results will be saved in that file.

Additional Features: We've added some exciting additional features to enhance your experience with the Recipe Search program:

Order by Weight: Search results can be ordered by weight, helping you find recipes with your preferred portion sizes.
Personalized Suggestions: The program will ask you additional questions based on your dietary preferences and desired calorie intake to recommend suitable recipes.
Important Note
Please note that the API key for this project is not provided in the code to ensure the security of your API credentials. Make sure to replace the YOUR_APP_ID and YOUR_APP_KEY placeholders in the recipe_search.py file with your own Edamam API credentials.

We hope you enjoy using the Recipe Search program to discover new and delicious recipes effortlessly. Feel free to explore and share your feedback with us. Happy cooking!
